- One probabalistic model

### Notes

```text
WARNING (theano.configdefaults): g++ not detected ! Theano will be unable to execute optimized C-implementations (for both CPU and GPU) and will default to Python implementations. Performance will be severely degraded. To remove this warning, set Theano flags cxx to an empty string.
WARNING (theano.tensor.blas): Using NumPy C-API based implementation for BLAS functions.
```

# TODO

- Use arviz to allow discarding burn and to caompare model with LOO and/or WAIC <https://docs.pymc.io/en/v3/pymc-examples/examples/diagnostics_and_criticism/model_comparison.html>.
